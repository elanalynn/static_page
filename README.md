# CPR Static Page with HTL/CSS (SCSS)

This is a quick static layout of the Colorado Public Radio hompage, built with HTML and SCSS.

## SCSS

This folder contains the built version of the CSS, so you can load the final HTML with no additional steps. However, reading the SCSS is going to be a lot more pleasant!

To make updates to styles, you will first need to install node modules (`yarn install`) and then run `yarn sass:watch` to watch the scss file for changes.
